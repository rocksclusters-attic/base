# In bootstrap0, create an OS and Updates roll after the Rocks database is up and running.

# First take on bootstrap0. Packages, command line and processing to
# bring up the rocks database on a non-Rocks installed host.
# Also reworked generation of post sections to work more like Solaris:
# Each post section now creates a shell script with the desired interpreter.
# Report post command creates a shell script from the post section of a
# (set of) node xml files.
