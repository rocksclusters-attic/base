# The "Why did you do that?" saga...
#
# Obviously patching anaconda did not work.
# Python snippet in the kickstart file are still failing (obviously :-()
#
# This time I try upgrading python with the same source code used by the
# original python from RH (heavily patched), let's hope The Force will be
# with me this time...
#
# Revision 1.4  2012/10/19 18:25:50  clem
# Another installment of "Why did you do that?"
#
# Redhat decided to patch python 2.4.3 and to move some function which once where in
# os.py as a built-in methods (this is a python 2.6 code) with no version change
# though.
#
# This obviously messes up when you run foundation-python insde anaconda which has
# the pythonpath pointing to the redhat libraries first.
#
# Here some more description of the bug:
