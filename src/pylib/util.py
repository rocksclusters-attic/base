# Get everything in before travel.  Rocks-roll is looking pretty good and
# can now build the os roll (centos with updates).  It looks like only the
# first CDROM of our os/centos roll is needed with 3 extra disks.
#
# - rocks-dist cleanup (tossed a ton of code)
# - rocks-roll growth (added 1/2 a ton of code)
# - bootable rolls do not work
# - meta rolls are untested
# - rocks-dist vs. rocks-roll needs some redesign but fine for 4.0.0
#
# Revision 1.3  2005/03/31 22:40:11  mjk

# 411 group support. Also cleaned out some depricated options.
#
# Revision 1.14  2004/04/28 21:05:44  fds
# Rocks-dist optimization for cross-kickstarting. Do not need the awkward
# --genhdlist flag anymore.
# o Will automatically find the native genhdlist executable, but
# o requires the native dist be made first.

# Revision 1.2  2001/04/27 01:08:50  mjk
# - Created working 7.0 and 7.1 distibutions (in same tree even)
# - Added symlink() method to File object.  Trying to get the File object
#   to make the decision on absolute vs. relative symlinks.  So far we are
#   absolute everywhere.
# - Still missing CD making code.  Need to figure out how to read to
#   comps files using RedHat's anaconda python code.  Then we can decide
#   which RPMs can go on the second CD based on what is required in the
#   kickstart files.
#
# Revision 1.1  2001/04/18 01:20:38  mjk
# - Added build.py, util.py modules
#
# - Getting closer.  I'm happy with the object model for building
# mirrors, and this will extend well to build the distributions.
#
# - Seriously needs a design document.
