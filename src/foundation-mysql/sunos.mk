# Remove all references to solaris, and added references to sunos.
# This is to standardize the naming between the python scripts and

# Compilation fixed for solaris and made a little more generic and backward

# mysql5 runs on linux

# Moved cluster-kickstart-solaris to the base roll admin package. Made more
# sense to put it there rather than in rocks-boot. Since others may have another
# opinion, I left the other files in the same spot.
#
# Alpha roll build pkgs along with RPMs.
# Foundation-mysql Makefile errors corrected.
# rocks-console gets its own solaris version for now. The changes are minimal and will
# be merged back to the original rocks-console.py file as soon as I've had a
# chance to test it further.
