# Set rpath into foundation-mysql libraries
#
# we set the path to load the shared library in /opt/rocks/lib/mysql
# using RPATH instead of the system wide /etc/ld.conf.d/ for all the
# foundation-mysql executables and shared library
#
# Adding this path to the /etc/ld.conf.d/ would change the default beaviour
# of the system mysql which we don't want to happen

# First take on bootstrap0. Packages, command line and processing to
# bring up the rocks database on a non-Rocks installed host.
# Also reworked generation of post sections to work more like Solaris:
# Each post section now creates a shell script with the desired interpreter.
# Report post command creates a shell script from the post section of a
# (set of) node xml files.

# Revision 1.10  2007/01/23 01:39:45  anoop
# Moved cluster-kickstart-solaris to the base roll admin package. Made more
# sense to put it there rather than in rocks-boot. Since others may have another
# opinion, I left the other files in the same spot.
#
# Alpha roll build pkgs along with RPMs.
# Foundation-mysql Makefile errors corrected.
# rocks-console gets its own solaris version for now. The changes are minimal and will
# be merged back to the original rocks-console.py file as soon as I've had a
# chance to test it further.
#
# Revision 1.9  2006/12/06 00:20:21  anoop
# All the Makefiles get a bit of an overhaul
#
# $(INSTALL) is used instead of install
# $(MAKE) is used instead of make or gmake
# $(TAR) is used instead of tar of gtar
#
# The mode argument for the $(INSTALL) command needs to be numeric and
# follow the convention of
#
# install [-cs] [-g group] [-m mode] [-o owner] file ...  destination
# install  -d   [-g group] [-m mode] [-o owner] dir
#
# This is portable across solaris and linux.
#
# Finally "tar xzf $TARFILE.tar.gz" is replaced with "gunzip -c $TARFILE.tar.gz | tar -xf -"
# This is again done for portability.
#
# This needs to be the convention from now on.
#
# Revision 1.8  2006/12/02 01:04:54  anoop
# Ridiculously big ass commit.
# Also known as the week after thanksgiving 2006. Or "The day Anoop
# broke Rocks".
#
# Main Changes.
#
# 1. Added a roll-profile.mk file. This is meant as a makefile for building
# the profile rpm containing all the XML files meant for the roll. This is a
# breakaway from the spec.in file method of building the profile RPM.
#
# 2. The variable PWD is now changed to CURDIR. The main reason for this is
# PWD is supplied by the shell. CURDIR is the variable supplied by gmake itself.
# This means we can have a slightly more platform independant way of doing things.
# Also Solaris was failing to set PWD correctly in the source directories, wreaking
# havoc on the location of the BUILD and PKG directories.
