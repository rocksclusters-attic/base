# move over to new build system.
#
# this has the side effect of fixing a problem reported by Noam Bernstein
# where rocks-dist in a cross-kickstart configuration would choose one
# ganglia-receptor*noarch.rpm from either the i386 or the x86_64 hpc roll,
# which would cause greceptor to not work on the non-choosen architecture.
#
# the new build environment removes the 'noarch.rpm' and replaces it with
# the i386.rpm, x86_64.rpm, etc.
