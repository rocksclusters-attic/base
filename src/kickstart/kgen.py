# fix arch check
#
# Revision 1.68  2005/02/11 23:38:16  mjk
# - blow up the bridge
# - kgen and kroll do actually work (but kroll is not complete)
# - file,roll attrs added to all tags by kpp
# - gen has generator,nodefilter base classes
# - replaced rcs ci/co code with new stuff
# - very close to adding rolls on the fly
#
# Revision 1.67  2004/12/11 00:26:43  fds
# Fixed bug that would cause touched files with perms attributes to fail (such as in shepherd.xml).
#
# Revision 1.66  2004/11/24 20:30:55  bruno
# this fixes the following problem:
#
# - someone creates a new appliance
# - in the node XML for the new appliance, they include custom partitioning info
# - when kickstart.cgi is run, it outputs:
#
# 	part <custom 1>
# 	part <custom 2>
# 	part <custom 3>
# 	.
# 	.
# 	.
# 	part
#
# the last 'part' tells the installer to add the default partitioning (this
# came from auto-partition.xml), thus, the new appliance gets the custom
# partitioning *and* the default partitioning.
#
# the fix: if custom partitioning is specified, then don't output 'part'. if
# custom partitioning is not specified, then do output 'part'.
#
# Revision 1.65  2004/09/18 15:09:34  bruno
# ok, i think i really got it now.
#
# backed out the change to kgen.py
#
# moved the 'disable' kernel package from node-thin to media-server
#
# and, make sure that a kickstarting host doesn't explictly call out the
# kernel or kernel-smp packages
#
# Revision 1.64  2004/09/18 14:30:15  bruno
# some tweaks to let anaconda decide which package to install (kernel or
# kernel-smp) because if we explictly set it (e.g., kernel-smp), then
# there is the case where the kernel-smp package is installed on an EM64T
# node and only the 'kernel' package should be on it.
#
# Revision 1.63  2004/08/27 18:21:06  bruno
# add a package to the "off" list when it is not in the "on" list.
#
# and, a package in the "on" list means it must not be in the "off" list.
#
# makes sense, yes?
#
# Revision 1.62  2004/04/27 17:18:59  fds
# I respectfully submit the following changes. It is less code, more inline with
# the strategies used in other parts of the kickstart generation, and has the
# same behavior as before.

# thats it.
#
# Kgen now knows how to only output the installclass.
