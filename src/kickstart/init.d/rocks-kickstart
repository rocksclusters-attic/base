# change the kickstart.cgi load throttling code into a counting semaphore.
# initialize the semaphore to the number of CPUs on the frontend multiplied by 2.
# as the number of CPUs on the frontend increases, we'll be able to support
# more concurrent executions of kpp.
#
# also, create an init script that removes the kickstart.cgi.lck file every
# time the service is started/stopped. this ensures a frontend reboot will
# reset the state of the throttling code.
