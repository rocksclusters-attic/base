#
# Encodes a comma-separated list of compute node names, using 
# a shorthand suggested by MPD. A pattern is used to tell the 
# encoder where to compress the list.
#
# Example 1:
# Pattern: "compute-0-%d"
#
# Encoding:
# compute-0-0 compute-0-1 compute-0-2 -> compute-0-%d:0-2
#
# Example 2:
# Pattern: "compute-0-%d"
#
# Encoding:
# compute-0-0 compute-0-2 compute-0-3 ->
#	compute-0-%d:0,2-3
#
# Example 3 (harder):
# Pattern: "compute-%d-%d"
#
# Encoding:
# compute-0-0 compute-0-1 compute-1-0 compute-1-1 ->
#	compute-0-%d:0-1 compute-1-%d:0-1
#
# This encoder expands on MPDs idea by allowing
# an arbitrary number of %d wildcards in the pattern.
#
# It also factors out duplicates (for SMPs):
#
# compute-0-0 compute-0-0 compute-0-1 compute-0-1 compute-0-2 ->
#	2*compute-0-%d:0-1 compute-0-%d:2-2
#
# Intended for use the Rocks ganglia-queue reporting module for Greceptor,
# as it will shorten the size of monitoring messages significantly.
