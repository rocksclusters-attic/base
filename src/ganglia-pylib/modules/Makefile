# Main change -
#
# Modifications to a lot of XML files. I apologize if people feel that I've
# stepped on someone else's toes here, but right now, the MANPATH variable is
# causing a bit of a headache and needs to be rethought. So all additions to
# the MANPATH variable are done via the /etc/man.config file.
#
# Please do not write shell scripts and profile.d files setting the MANPATH variable present
# as this would override the /etc/man.config file, and most man pages will not be
# available to you.
#
# Smaller changes -
#
# Refreshing packages in the xena roll. Development of xena halted for the next few weeks atleast
# Change the python version number that ganglia-python uses.
# Note added to NCBI Blast regarding upgrades in the future.
