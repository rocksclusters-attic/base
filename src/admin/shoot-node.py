# Changes to shootnode and rocks-console. These changes were necessary to
# support shooting multiple nodes in one command. The threading in shoot-node
# would cause a lot of problems because multiple threads would try to manipulate
# stderr, and all would fail but one.
#
# Also race conditions are created by the presence of threads, and so sockets need
# to be released only at the last possible moment, to avoid multiple bindings.
