#
# Revision 1.4  2011/06/16 22:47:27  anoop
# Bug fixes. Remove empty lines and malformed lines while processing

# Revision 1.3  2011/05/11 19:29:16  anoop
# Bug fix. Make sure even new entries get propogated
#
# Revision 1.2  2011/04/27 00:03:39  anoop
# Minor improvements to the way shadow entries are transmitted.
#
# Revision 1.1  2011/04/26 23:24:04  anoop
# Added shadow file plugin to only transfer shadow information
# for users over UID 500
