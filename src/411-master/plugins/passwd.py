# Revision 1.12  2011/06/17 05:46:32  anoop
# -Bug fixes to passwd and shadow filters.
# -The filters now correctly add and remove
#  users with UID > 500 who are not system
#  users.
#
# Revision 1.11  2011/06/16 22:47:27  anoop
# Bug fixes. Remove empty lines and malformed lines while processing
#
# Revision 1.10  2011/06/13 20:10:26  anoop
# Ignore blank lines
#
# Revision 1.9  2011/05/11 19:29:16  anoop
# Bug fix. Make sure even new entries get propogated
#
# Revision 1.8  2011/04/27 00:20:52  anoop
# Transfer only password entries which are greater than UID 500
# Also merge entries into the password file rather than overwriting them
# Merge entries so that only users with UID > 500 are overwritten.
#
# Revision 1.7  2011/04/26 23:23:27  anoop
# Minor modification to 411put. Use a get_filename function instead of
# a filename constant.
#
# Revision 1.6  2011/04/21 17:28:20  anoop
# 411 plugins now take advantage of attributes
#
# Revision 1.5  2010/09/07 23:52:48  bruno
# star power for gb

# Revision 1.4  2009/05/01 19:06:50  mjk

# copyright 5.1
#
# Revision 1.2  2008/08/12 23:20:13  anoop
# Added filter for auto.master
#
# Modified 411 transport to encode content of the file
# and filter before encrypting them. This helps with the
# problem of stripping whitespaces, and returns the content
# of the files exactly as they should be.
#
# Also modified the password and group filters just a little
# to make them return the correct whitespaces
#
# Revision 1.1  2008/08/09 19:27:51  anoop
# beginning of actual usable 411 plugins. For now password and group file
# plugins
