# Ridiculously big ass commit.
# Also known as the week after thanksgiving 2006. Or "The day Anoop
# broke Rocks".
#
# Main Changes.
#
# 1. Added a roll-profile.mk file. This is meant as a makefile for building
# the profile rpm containing all the XML files meant for the roll. This is a
# breakaway from the spec.in file method of building the profile RPM.
#
# 2. The variable PWD is now changed to CURDIR. The main reason for this is
# PWD is supplied by the shell. CURDIR is the variable supplied by gmake itself.
# This means we can have a slightly more platform independant way of doing things.
# Also Solaris was failing to set PWD correctly in the source directories, wreaking
# havoc on the location of the BUILD and PKG directories.
#
# Revision 1.4  2006/07/26 20:29:18  bruno
# make sure to prune the directories when we check them out
#
# Revision 1.3  2006/07/14 04:45:09  phil
# Add TAG to get specific version of the repository
#
# Revision 1.2  2006/06/24 00:26:09  nadya
# use variable for cvs
#
# Revision 1.1  2005/12/14 21:13:49  bruno
# create an RPM that has:
#
#  - minimum number of files and tree structure in order to build a roll
#  - the 'template' roll (to serve as an example of how to build a roll)
#  - the 'restore' roll (used to backup the important info in your cluster)
#
# Revision 1.1  2005/12/13 04:59:41  bruno
# the start of the 'frontend restore' roll
