# - linux and solaris both send only .info and above to the frontend
#   debug stays off the network
# - changed syslog levels to debug (see above)
# - proper wait return code handling with W* macros
#
# Revision 1.2  2010/10/21 20:51:17  mjk
# - timestamp is now a timeval (microseconds)
# - re-entry testing is done in 411-alert-handler using a pickle file for state
# - more logging
#
# Looks good, but need to turn down the logging to keep the network quite.

# 411 hardcore. Achieve reliable multicast the same way ganglia does:
# repeat yourself until you are hoarse. Use 'receptor' classes to inform
# a Repeater411 metric of new alerts, which are then re-published every
# 20sec for an hour.
#
# Assumes receipt of your own mcast packet is reliable. This design should
# achieve reliable 411 alerts in the long run, while maintaining simplicity.
