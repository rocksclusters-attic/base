	"""
	Add a firewall rule to the a category in cluster.

	<arg type='string' name='category=index'>
	[global,os,appliance,host]=index.

	Must precede all other a=b parameters

	Apply rule to index (member) of category. e.g.
	os=linux, appliance=login, or host=compute-0-0.

	global, global=, and global=global all refer
	to the global category
	</arg>

	<param type='string' name='rulename'>
	User-defined name of rule. Required.
	Firewall rules are ordered lexicographically. 
	</param>

	<param type='string' name='rulesrc' optional='1'>
	system or custom. Default is 'custom'. Rules defined as
	'system' are not dumped with rocks dump firewall. 
	</param>

	<param type='string' name='service'>
	The service identifier, port number or port range. For example
	"www", 8080 or 0:1024.
	To have this firewall rule apply to all services, specify the
	keyword 'all'.
	</param>

	<param type='string' name='protocol'>
	The protocol associated with the rule. For example, "tcp" or "udp".
	To have this firewall rule apply to all protocols, specify the
	keyword 'all'.
	</param>
	
	<param type='string' name='network'>
	The network this rule should be applied to. This is a named network
	(e.g., 'private') and must be one listed by the command
	'rocks list network'.
	To have this firewall rule apply to all networks, specify the
	keyword 'all'.
	</param>

	<param type='string' name='output-network' optional='1'>
	The output network this rule should be applied to. This is a named
	network (e.g., 'private') and must be one listed by the command
	'rocks list network'.
	</param>

	<param type='string' name='chain'>
	The iptables 'chain' this rule should be applied to (e.g.,
	INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD).
	</param>

	<param type='string' name='action'>
	The iptables 'action' this rule should be applied to (e.g.,
	ACCEPT, REJECT, DROP).
	</param>

	<example cmd='add firewall appliance=login rulename=ACCEPT-SSH network=public service="ssh" protocol="tcp" action="ACCEPT" chain="INPUT" flags="-m state --state NEW"'>
	Accept TCP packets for the ssh service on the public network on
	the INPUT chain and apply the "-m state --state NEW" flags to the
	rule.
        
	Apply the rule to login appliances (appliance=login)

	Name the rule ACCEPT-SSH

	If 'eth1' is associated with the public network, this will be
	translated as the following iptables rule:
	"-A INPUT -i eth1 -p tcp --dport ssh -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT"
	</example>

	<example cmd='add firewall global rulename=ACCEPT-PRIVATE network=private service="all" protocol="all" action="ACCEPT" chain="INPUT"'>
	Accept all protocols and all services on the private network on the
	INPUT chain.

	Apply this rule to all nodes in the cluster (global)

	If 'eth0' is the private network, then this will be translated as
	the following iptables rule:
	"-A INPUT -i eth0 -j ACCEPT"
	</example>


	<example cmd='add firewall host=compute-0-0 rulename=ZZDRACONIAN network="all" service="all" protocol="all" action="DROP" chain="INPUT"'>
	DROP all non-matched packets

	Apply this rule to host compute-0-0 (host=compute-0-0)

	rule will be named ZZDRACONIAN 

	This will drop all non-matched packets  that have not been previously accepted
	Known as a draconian firewall rule.
