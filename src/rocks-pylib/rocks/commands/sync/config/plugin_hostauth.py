# need to use full path to /opt/rocks/bin/rocks
#
# If not during the installation when rocks sync config in an init script
# it fails because it does not find rocks
#
# Revision 1.5  2012/10/04 21:55:01  phil
# sync only to self and to subordinate login appliances. Generic frontends was too expansive as it included virtual frontends too.
#
# Revision 1.4  2012/08/14 17:29:30  phil
# with hostbased authentication, remove /etc/ssh/rocks_autogen_user_keys on frontend
# and login appliances
#
# Revision 1.3  2012/08/14 04:51:45  phil
# Generate ssh_known_hosts file.
# Works when hosts are multi-homed (like Triton)
#
# Revision 1.2  2012/08/13 05:12:17  phil
# Hostbased Authentication now default method. Thanks, Roy Dragseth.
