# - Added support for contiguous networks.  But, we can't use this code
#   until we switch to the 10.0.0.0 network.
#
# Revision 1.1  2001/05/16 21:44:40  mjk
# - Major changes in CD building
# - Added ip.py, sql.py for SQL oriented scripts
#



# This code now no longer assumes a default netmask and supports
# subnets.  Subnet have some complex rules and implications.  Make
# sure you really need to do this.  Non-contiguous subnets are not
# supported.

# The basic form of an ip address is network-subnet-host.  The main
# rule is both the host and subnet portion cannot have all the bits
# set or all the bits unset.  This mean some addresses that people
# like to use are just wrong.

# For example the address 192.168.0.1 is invalid.  This is because the
# network is not a class B network rather a set of 254 class C
# addresses.  This is why subnets get scary.  Several people do not
# understand this and run around with bogus ip addresses.
